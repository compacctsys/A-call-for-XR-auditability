## Overview

XR systems (Virtual, Augmented and Virtual Reality) are growing in prominence. With any new technology comes risk, and XR is no exception. Indeed, the novel interaction modalities and the immersive nature (manipulating/impeding senses) of XR presents some unique risks. This is particularly important given the adoption of the tech by more risk-averse sectors such as manufacturing, surgery, training, construction and the military, to name a few.

Auditability of XR systems can help in this regard. That is, capturing information about how XR systems are used, how they operate and how various components (internal and external) interact can help to unpack failures/harms be they due to usage, technical, administrative or social complications. This 'audit data' can also help identify failures before they occur, demonstrate that systems operate/perform in line with regulations and design specifications and more generally, can help towards making XR more compliant, transparent and safer -- properties that will undoubtedly affect the technologies adoption.

## Survey background

We conducted a survey exploring the state of audit practices 'in the wild' for a range of emerging technologies and stakeholders.

Our research proposal for this work was reviewed was approved by our institution's ethical committee (for further information, see: www.research-integrity.admin.cam.ac.uk/research-ethics), and consent was obtained from all participants. All questions were optional and randomised, data was anonymised and participants gave their explicit consent for us to use their responses.

For this paper, we compiled our results based only on those participants that said that they work with XR (AR/VR/MR) technologies; we did this in order to make three broad and general points as elaborated in our paper.
